# Instacart-Market-Basket-Prediction
## Introduction
As the internet continues to grow, online shopping is becoming increasingly popular. If websites could predict what customers will buy during each shopping session, it could enhance the customer experience and increase website traffic, thereby increasing profits. This project aims to use data provided by Kaggle to predict customers' future shopping lists based on the types, quantities, and frequencies of items they have purchased in the past.The project file also includes a PDF file for presentation .
## Project Details
•	Developed customer-based and item-based features to predict reorder patterns on online grocery website.\
•	Improved model F1 score to 0.38 by stacking base models and performing hyper-parameter tuning .\
•	Visualized prediction distribution and feature importance in Matplotlib.
## Metrics : Why F1 and Accuracy
•	Using both allows you to have a more comprehensive evaluation of your model.\
•	Accuracy provides a general view of the model performance, while the F1 score can give you more insights into the balance between precision and recall.\
•	They are widely understood and accepted, making it easier to compare the performance of different models or algorithms.
